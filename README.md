**Hello, my name is Bahadir. But you can call me "vortique".**

I'm a software developer still learning and growing. The programming languages I use most are C# and Python. And I want to learn many more in the future.

### Projects I'm Currently Working On

- CLIExplorer - Terminal-based file explorer in C#.
- VortiqueUtils - Re-implementations of UNIX commands in C#.

### Future Projects

- [ ] GUI File Explorer in C#.
- [ ] Writing better Windows core programs. (like File Explorer, Notepad, Paint etc.)
- [ ] Making working AI model with Python. (I'm currently learning the basics of AI, but working hard to improve.)

### Programming Languages I Want to Learn in the Future

- C++ - For robotics.
- SQL - For database tasks.
- Maybe C - I'm interested in low-level development because of Linux, but it's challenging.
